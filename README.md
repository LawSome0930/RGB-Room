# RGB-Room
When people enter the room, they trigger the human body sensor, and RGB lights up one by one. When all RGB lights are on, the room light is turned on.
### List
1. Arduino UNO
2. Two way relay
3. Human body sensor
4. WS2812B light strip (I choose 5m light strip，30 lamp/m)
5. 5V DC Power (Select power based on the number of beads, 0.3W/lamp bead. I choose 5V-10A power)
6. Wire (I choose wire with a cross-sectional area of 2 square millimeters，because the maximum current supplied by the power supply reaches 10A)
